Description: **Welcome to PyCountryCode's documentation!** 
        =============================================
        
        **What it is?**
        I have always loved knowing stuff. I love knowledge, it is my first love before anything else. In every kind of setup I finf myself in I am always participating because I almost always have an idea about most things. This love of knowledge also made it easy for me to know more country telephone codes. 
        
        However, the truth is I couldn't cram them all the country codes and retrieve them from my mind everytime it became necessary. I knew by heart those of the most popular countries that includes Russia (+7), UK (+44), USA (+1), Australia (+61) and of course Zimbabwe amongst many others.
        
        **Why?**
        Someone wanted to know what code +52 was for which country, I didn't know, I was embarrassed at myself. I challenged myself by writing this package so I and anyone else can use to get the country calling code of any country and also to get a country after passing in a calling code you know but are not sure about the country of origin.
        
        **Inspiration**
        I wanted to write something that others could find useful.
