Description: **Welcome to PyCountryCode's documentation!**
        =============================================
        
        **What it is?**
        I have always loved knowing stuff. I love knowledge, it is my first love before anything else. In every kind of setup I find myself in I am always participating because I almost always have an idea about most things. This love of knowledge also made it easy for me to know more country telephone codes.
        
        However, the truth is I couldn't cram them all the country codes and retrieve them from my mind every time it became necessary. I knew by heart those of the most popular countries that includes Russia (+7), UK (+44), USA (+1), Australia (+61) and of course Zimbabwe amongst many others.
        
        **Why?**
        Someone wanted to know what code +52 was for which country, I didn't know, I was embarrassed at myself. I challenged myself by writing this package so I and anyone else can use to get the country calling code of any country and also to get a country after passing in a calling code you know but are not sure about the country of origin.
        
        **Inspiration**
        I wanted to write something that others could find useful.
        
        
        **Installation**
        ***pip install pycountrycode***
        
        **Importing the 'getCode' function**
        ***from pycountrycode.pycountrycode import getCode***
        
        - ***getCode('Zimbabwe')***
        - '+263'
        - ***getCode('New Zealand')***
        - '+64'
        - ***getCode('Peru')***
        - '+51'
        - ***getCode('Madagascar')***
        - '+261'
        - ***getCode('Russia')***
        - '+7'
        - ***getCode('Australia')***
        - '+61'
        - ***getCode('Israel')***
        - '+972'
        - ***getCode('Male')***
        - 'Undefined country'
        
        **importing the 'getCountry' function.**
        ***from pycountrycode.countrycode import getCountry***
        
        - ***getCountry('+52')***
        - 'Mexico'
        - ***getCountry('+56')***

        - ***getCountry('+86')***
        - 'China'
        - ***getCountry('+3')***
